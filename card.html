              her studies, plays sports during extracurricular hours and works
              part-time. </a

              >The course Aurora attends requires her to do several reading and
              research assignments, however, these activities become difficult
              as she has difficulty concentrating on reading long text.
            </a>
            <br />
            <br />
            <a>
              To help her with her reading, Aurora uses a software program that
              highlights each paragraph of text where she has her cursor so that
              she can concentrate on one small portion of the text at a time.
            </a>
            <br />
            <br />
            <a>
              Although this is not always the case, she has a preference for
              minimalist websites with only one column and little information,
              where the only color is in the images that help interpret the
              text.
            </a>
            <br />
            <br />
            <a>
              To better manage her time and tasks, Aurora uses the Trello tool
              where she can list everything she needs to do through checklists,
              which ultimately helps with anxiety control.
